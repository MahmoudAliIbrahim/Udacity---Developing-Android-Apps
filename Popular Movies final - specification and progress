Things I want to accomplish with my Popular movies app:

* fix the settings: 
  * [OPTIONAL] integrate twitter share: if I find a separate pane is necessary, add it in and fix back navigation from the first screen pink config launcher
  * otherwise, get rid of the teired settings and make it a single pane.
* ensure that being able to share a movie from the details pane is not part of the project. Maybe add it anyway
* [OPTIONAL] spruce up or replace the text only SVG
* [OPTIONAL] add the same spacing to vertical as horizontal in posters view 
* [OPTIONAL] support Similar tag from `movies/id/similar` in the api
* [OPTIONAL - strongly rec.] change color scheme to red... red/black?

* view and play trailers, reviews (`movies/id/reviews` and `movies/id/videos`)
* implement a favorites database, markable star -> favorite at details page
* add settings option to allow users to view their favorites, and change the `FloatingActionButton` to go directly to favorites and only show up when the settings option isn't also to the favorites.

* optimize display for tablet

## Progress
Tuesday — completed lesson 6
Wednesday — read the task papers for Final Project, organized, prepared, celebrated completing lesson 6
Thursday — 
    build the SQLite db for Favorites, refactored a bit to seperate concerns
    translated over to Services from AsyncTasks
Friday — implemented trailers, reviews, _need to reformat the XML a bit_
Saturday — implemented Favorites, _need to configure FloatingActionButton_,  some OPTIONALs
Sunday — optimize for tablet
    I ran into a problem optimizing for tablet. Solution was found by doing the ui completely separately: [3-2-1 rotate](https://github.com/robbiemu/3-2-1-rotate)
    This was completed by Tuesday, the 5th.
    Implemented the solution for the project by the 8th. (Moving the old probject over was a careful proceedure)

Completion: On the 9th I completed the floating action bar and favorites views, tidied up code, and finished.
